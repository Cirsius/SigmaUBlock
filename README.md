This is a tutorial for "unblocking" school owned Dell Latitude 3120's. if you have a different type of dell windows laptop, when you install the drivers, use the driver version for that type of laptop. 
There's 2 routes. Tiny10, and Windows10. Tiny10 does NOT come preinstalled with drivers at all, and driver installs on school computers is really freakilicious, so i cant recommend it. You'll have to do the driver installation all on your own with Tiny10.
